    "#### Hello Team, I think this is your first encounter with neural networks. This mini-project is to help you understand the various steps of learning with a neural network. This time, together you'll create a simple feed-forward neural net. Complexity of the neural nets that you'll create will keep increasing with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The learning problem: We'll try to create an AI that can recognize handwritten digits in the famous MNIST database (the same one 3Blue1Brown's video series on neural networks is based on, if you haven't watched at least the first two videos in the series, I can guarantee you that you won't find a more clear/visual explanation on the web).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it's going to work: Below I have laid out the different steps in the process. Every member's task is to write the part of the code that he/she has been assigned to. If your understanding of how an ANN works is clear, hopefully all your contributions will wake up our AI (even if you don't communicate with each other!). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### We'll be using Keras to implement the neural network as I've said before. Steps are of course sequential. Good luck!"
